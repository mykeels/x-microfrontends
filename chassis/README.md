# chassis

The chassis project is the shell app, that hosts other microfrontends.

Its name is a bit of a misnomer because _technically_, any microfrontend can be a shell app for other microfrontends, so you can have a nested microfrontend structure. This is not demonstrated in this project yet, however, but it shouldn't be difficult to do.
